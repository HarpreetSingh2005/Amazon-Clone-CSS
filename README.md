# Amazon Clone

Tiny, single-purpose HTML + CSS replica of Amazon’s desktop layout. This is a project, made for practicing newly learnt skills, HTML and CSS. Was a fun project and had a practical experience of developing front-end, although a very basic one, but enjoyed it and was fun to work on it. Was a good to start project for a new learner.

## What's inside

- index.html for basic front-end structure
- style.css for the styling
- Images used in project
